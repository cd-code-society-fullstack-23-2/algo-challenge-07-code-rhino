**Description**:  
Hello, Code Enthusiasts! ðŸŒŸ Here's a fun yet challenging task! You're asked to reverse a string, but wait â€“ there's more to it. Each word in your reversed string should have its FIRST letter capitalized. Sounds simple, right? Think again. Your challenge is set with a few interesting constraints to make things more exciting!
